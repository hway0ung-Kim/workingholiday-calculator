## Technical Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: npm Dependency Conflicts
**Problem**: TypeScript version conflicts between React Scripts (4.9.5) and i18next (requires 5.x)
**Solution**: 
- Added `"overrides": { "typescript": "^4.9.5" }` to package.json
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag in Vercel deployment
- Downgraded tailwindcss to 3.4.0 for stability

### Issue 2: JSON Module Import Types
**Problem**: TypeScript couldn't resolve JSON file imports
**Solution**: Created `src/types/json.d.ts` with module declaration for `*.json` files

### Issue 3: Tailwind CSS Class Definition
**Problem**: Missing color definitions in Tailwind config
**Solution**: Added complete color palette definitions for success-700 and other missing variants

### Issue 4: Firebase MCP Directory Recognition
**Problem**: Firebase MCP couldn't recognize project directory
**Solution**: Used Firebase CLI directly for configuration and deployment

## Development Workflow

### Current Development Environment
- **Local Server**: `npm run dev` (React development server)
- **Live Preview**: http://localhost:3000
- **Vercel Deployment**: https://workingholiday-calculator-o25l30pzo-hway0ung-kims-projects.vercel.app
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/hway0ung-Kim/workingholiday-calculator

### Testing Strategy
